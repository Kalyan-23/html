    <p><b>Cricket</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat-and-ball_games">bat-and-ball</a> game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is a 22-yard (<i>20-metre; 66-foot</i>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch">pitch</a> with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch">wicket</a> at each end, each comprising two (<i>small sticks</i>) balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket holding bats, while one player from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fielding_(cricket)">fielding</a> team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_(cricket)">boundary</a> of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.</p>

    <h2><u> History of Cricket </u>:</h2>
    <img src="cricket1.jpg" width="300" height="200">
    <p> The sport of cricket has a known history beginning in the late 16th century England. It became an established sport in the country in the 18th century and developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since the 19th-century and formal Test cricket matches are considered to date from 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport, after association football (soccer).</p><br>
    Internationally, cricket is governed by the <b style="color: rgb(13, 28, 120);">International Cricket Council (ICC)</b>, which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership, although only twelve currently play Test cricket.<br>
    The game's rules are defined in the "<b>Laws of cricket</b>". The game has various formats, ranging from T-10(<i>Ten-10</i>) played in around 90 minutes to Test matches, which can last up to five days.</p>

    <h2><u>21st-century cricket </u>:</h2>
    <p>The 21st century brought with it the Bangladesh Team, who made their Test debut in 2000. The game itself also grew, with a new format made up of 20-over innings being created. This format, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20">T20 cricket</a>, quickly became a highly popular format, putting the longer formats at risk. The new shorter format also introduced franchise cricket, with new tournaments like the Indian Premier League and the Australian Big Bash League. The ICC has selected the T20 format as cricket's growth format, and has introduced a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men%27s_T20_World_Cup">T20 World Cup</a> which is played every two years;T20 cricket has also been increasingly accepted into major events such as the Asian Games. The resultant growth has seen cricket's fanbase cross one billion people, with 90% of them in South Asia. T20's success has also spawned even shorter formats, such as 10-over cricket (T10) and 100-ball cricket, though not without controversy.</p><br>
    <p><b><u>Expansion of the game</u></b>:</p> <br>
    <img src="cricket2.jpg" width="300" height="200">
    <p> In June 2001, the ICC introduced a "<b>Test Championship Table</b>" and, in October 2002, a "One-day International Championship Table". As indicated by ICC rankings, the various cricket formats have continued to be a major competitive sport in most former British Empire countries, notably the Indian subcontinent, and new participants including the Netherlands. In 2017, the number of countries with full ICC membership was increased to twelve by the addition of <b style="color: rgb(15, 24, 121);">"Afganistan</b>" and <b style="color: rgb(21, 23, 116);" >"Ireland"</b>.<b>ICC</b> expanded its development programme, aiming to produce more national teams capable of competing at the various formats. Development efforts are focused on African and Asian nations, and on the United States. In 2004, the ICC Intercontinental Cup brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, mostly for the first time.</p>

    <h1><u>CHESS</u></h1>
    <img src="chess.jpg" width="500" height="300">
</center>

<p><b>Chess</b> is a board game for two players. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to     distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi (<i>Chinese chess</i>) and shogi (<i>Japanese chess</i>). <br>

  <b>Chess</b> is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The players, referred to generically as "<b>White</b>" and "<b>Black</b>", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black; then moves alternate. The object of the game is to checkmate the enemy king. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.<br>
    
    The recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of a similar game, chaturanga, in seventh-century India. After its introduction in Persia, it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe. The rules of chess as they are known today emerged in Europe at the end of the <b style="color:blue";>15th century</b>, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the <b style="color:blue;">19th century</b>. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, with millions of players worldwide. </p>
    <p><b>URL:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess">CHESS</a></b></p>

    <h2><u>Rules</u>:</h2>
    <p>The rules of chess are published by <b>FIDE</b>(<i>Fédération Internationale des Échecs; "International Chess Federation"</i>), chess's world governing body, in its Handbook.Rules published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess organizations, commercial publishers, etc., may differ in some details. FIDE's rules were most recently revised in 2023.</p> <br>


    <img src="chess1.jpg" width="300" height="200"> <br>
    <b><u>Setup</u>:</b>

    <p> <b>Chess sets</b> come in a wide variety of styles. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staunton_chess_set">Staunton pattern</a> is the most common, and is usually required for competition. Chess pieces are divided into two sets, usually light and dark colored, referred to as white and black, regardless of the actual color or design. The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black, respectively. Each set consists of sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.
        
        The game is played on a square board of eight rows (<i>called ranks</i>) and eight columns (<i>called files</i>). Although it does not affect game play, by convention the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares. Common colors for wooden chessboards are light and dark brown, while vinyl chessboards are commonly buff and green.</p>

        <p>To start the game, White's pieces are placed on the first rank in the following order, from left to right: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook. Pawns are placed on each square of the second rank. Black's position mirrors White's, with equivalent pieces on every file. The board is oriented so that the right-hand corner nearest each player is a light square; as a result the white queen always starts on a light square, while the black queen starts on a dark square. This may be remembered by the phrases "light on the right" and "queen on her own color". <br>

            In formal competition, the piece colors for every matchup are allocated to players by the organizers. In informal games, colors are decided either by mutual agreement, or randomly, for example by a coin toss, or by one player concealing a white pawn in one hand and a black pawn in the other and having the opponent choose.</p> <br>

            <b><u>Movement</u>:</b> <br>

            <p>White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling">castling</a>, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant, all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies. Moving is compulsory; a player may not skip a turn, even when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zugzwang">having to move is detrimental.</a> <br>
            Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, crosses mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces). All pieces except the pawn can capture an enemy piece if it is on a square to which they could move if the square were unoccupied. Pieces are generally not permitted to move through squares occupied by pieces of either color, except for the knight and during castling.</p>


            <ul>
                <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_(chess)">King</a> moves one square in any direction. There is also a special move called castling that involves moving the king and a rook. The king is the most valuable piece—attacks on the king must be immediately countered, and if this is impossible, the game is immediately lost (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_(chess)">check</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate">checkmate</a> below).</li> <br>

                <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rook_(chess)">rock</a> can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(chess)">bishop</a>can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.                  
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(chess)">queen</a> combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.
                </li> <br>

                <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess)">knight</a> moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces. </li><br>

                <li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)">pawn</a> can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram). A pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square (black crosses). It cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file, nor can it move to either square diagonally in front without capturing. A pawn has two special moves: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#En_passant">en passant</a> capture and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess)">promotion</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <b><u>Time control</u>:</b> <br>
            <p>In competition, chess games are played with a time control. If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost (provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate).The duration of a game ranges from long (or "classical") games, which can take up to seven hours (even longer if adjournments are permitted), to bullet chess (under 3 minutes per player for the entire game). Intermediate between these are rapid chess games, lasting between one and two hours per game, a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments.</p>
            <img src="time.jpg" width="300" height="200">
            <p>Time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays, one for each player's remaining time. Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks, which allow for time controls with increments.<br>

                Time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competitions. A typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves.</p> <br>
